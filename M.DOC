<<<<<********** NOTE **********>>>>>>
This game was created in basic and compiled through use of the Quickbasic
compiler. As a result of it's size and complexity, I was not able to
incorporate this run-time module. It is simply used to start the program, then
needs not be present during excecution.

BRUN10.EXE- A run-time module used to startup the game. It must be present at
            start-up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             --INSTRUCIONS--

   This Monopoly game is run through a series of menus, all are governed by the
same rules and operate similarily. The menu options, as they are called, may
be chosen by use of the arrow keys, for moving the cursor, and then ENTER to
either go to a sub-menu or excecute the command, depending on the option.
Options may also be chosen by pressing the first letter of the option.
Options are invalid, or unuseable if they are in gray. This means that a
certain set of qualifications or circumstances was not met for this
menu option to be able to be used. Most menus are in white, other menus are in
the color of the current player in control or making the decisions. In these
circumstances it is important to observe the color and not mess with someone
else's player. ESC may always be use to exit a menu and return controll to
the previous menu, except when a choice must be made, such as when you must
choose from 10% or $200 on INCOME TAX, or when you must pay your bail after
your third day in jail. All menus follow these rules.


*** The PROPERTY menu:

   One menu, the PROPERTY menu, a sub-menu of the DEAL menu, has a few
more things that must be discussed. This menu is used to trade/sell property,
buy/sell houses, and mortgage/unmortgage property. All of these options are
run through not one cursor, but two cursors. One cursor governs which of the
menu options you have currently chosen. The other cusor points to the property
that you are currently working with from within your player box. The cusor
for the options moves by using the left and right arrow keys, or the first
letter of the option, as all menus do. The second cursor moves by use of the up
and down arrow keys.
       An example: You want to mortgage St. James Place.
            First: Place the property cursor on St. James Place with the up
                   or down arrow keys.
           Second: Choose MORTGAGE with the left or right arrow keys and
                   press RETURN/ENTER, or press the first letter of the option,
                   which happens to be M.
           RESULT: You have now mortgaged St. James Place and the income
                   gained from doing so is displayed directly underneath your
                   current wealth at the top of your player box.
To do the opposite of any option, such as unmortgaging a mortgaged property,
place the property cursor on the property to be unmortgaged and choose
MORTGAGE.

Purpose/function of the options:

MORTGAGE - This option lets you mortgage or unmortgage property, depending on
           the current prperty's state. If the property is not mortgaged, it
           will be mortgaged, if it is mortgaged, it will be unmortgaged.

+@- - This option adds/subtracts houses. The plus sign (+) and the
      minus sign (-) add and subtract houses from a property respectively.
<Note: You must build evenly! Check any Monopoly board game rules for details.>

TRADE - This option gives the property under the property cursor to the player
        as defined by the number in parenthesis.
             Ex: Choosing TRADE(1) when on the property cusor is on Reading R.R.
                 causes Reading R.R. to be given to player number one, the
                 player on the far left of the screen.
       Choosing this option again returns the property back to it's original
       owner.

 SEE - This option lets you check the property card of the property under the
       property cusor. This option would normally be used to check the value
       of a property before buying houses, trading, or mortgaging that property.
       Choosing this option again for the same property erases the card.

<THE CHECK> - The check on the far right of the the menu is used to enter
              all of the changes you have currently made to your set of
              properties. Otherwise you may press <ESC> to exit the menu
              without any changes.

** Colors: The use of colors in this menu is important.
        Here are descriptions:

    Within the menu options:
        Gray: This color is used to show that an option is unavailable
              for the current property.
               Ex: Mortage may be grayed out for a certain property if that
                   property is already mortgaged, which means you would be
                   unmortgaging the property, and you don't have enough to
                   unmortgage it.
           <Note: Unmortgaging a property includes repaying the mortgage value
                  PLUS 10% of the mortgage value. Read any Monopoly rulebook.>
        Other: Another color means that the option is valid for use.
               This color depends on the current player's color. It is used
               to show who is currently in control.

    Within the player box:
        Gray: Used to define the normal state, that is, not being mortgaged or
              traded, of a property.
       White: This color shows that the current property is mortgaged.
       Other: Any other color shows that the property has been traded and the
              color is then of the current owner.

                choose an option, there is always a good reason. Be patient,
                first thing is to check is whether you have enough money to

                traded, does it have houses on it, and if you own all of a
                group, do any of the other properties have houses on them, or
                are any of them mortgaged or traded? <Check the rules of a
